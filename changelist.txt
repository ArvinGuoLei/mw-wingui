Changed graph line width to 1 point
Added SUPRESSI2CERRORDATA setting to the gui_settings.xml file, when it set to True, then serial protocol changes introduced 
n SVN r569 are ignored, so dev20120203 will work with the GUI.
Log files folder setting was ignored in 1.00 now it works correctly.

For those who use older multiwii version than SVN r569 but newer than 1.9. there is a Compatibility Mode switch. After finishing the setup wizard, open gui_settings.xml and change SUPRESSI2CERRORDATA element's value to true. This will ignore the change in serial protocol which was introduced in SVNr569.
